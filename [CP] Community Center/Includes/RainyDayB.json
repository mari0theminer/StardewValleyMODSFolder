Event discussing Elliott's book:
69660007/q 958701/
'The Rise And Fall Of Planet Yazzo'... It's a sci-fi epic spanning thousands of years in an exotic planetary system.
Chapter One.
Commander Yutkin stepped through the golden archway as the airlock snapped shut behind him. Today was his first day on Planet Yazzo, and all 14 of the alliance delegates had been summoned to the Grand Spire...
...And as the 7th moon descended beneath the horizon, the planet of Yazzo would begin its sinister transformation... an event for which Commander Yutkin was completely unprepared.

958699:     'Blue Tower'... It's a mystery novel set in a surreal, dystopian future.
Chapter One.
From the shadows emerged a man, radiating with enigmatic omniscience. 'Good Evening, Mr. Lu,' he said, the corners of his mouth quivering. Lu seemed astonished. 'How did you know my name?'...
... Lu checked Jenu's pockets, then stood up and walked into the bedroom. He quickly found the small golden key that he was looking for and slipped it into his coat pocket.

958700:     'Camellia Station'... It's a romance novel about a train stewardess who falls in love with a traveling architect...
Chapter One.
'Your ticket, sir?' Ticket collector Gozman extended a gloved hand towards the young commuter. 'Ah, yes. I have it right here,' he replied, reaching into his coat pocket. Mortified, he discovered that the ticket was missing....
...'Clara, there's something I must tell you,' he blurted as she turned to leave. Clara turned, slowly, and saw the look of desperation in Horatio's eye. At that moment Gozman burst into the compartment, red-faced.
