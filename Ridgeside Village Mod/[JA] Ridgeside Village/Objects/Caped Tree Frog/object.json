	"Name": "Caped Tree Frog",
	"Description": "The red pattern that covers it's neck and back presents a cape like pattern. It has a strange behaviour of tucking one arm in while extending the other one whenever it leaps. This strange phenomenon seems to be not just for show, it is required because of the unique anatomical placement of it's internal organs to maintain balance. It is quite rare due to being hunted for domestic purposes.",
